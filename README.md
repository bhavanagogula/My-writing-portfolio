## About Me

I am a Technical Writer with 13+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling documentation for enterprise SaaS and iPaaS platforms, APIs, and cloud products. I specialize in transforming complex systems into clear, usable documentation that improves developer experience, customer adoption, and support efficiency.

My work spans end-to-end documentation ownership—API and SDK documentation, product and release documentation, structured knowledge bases, troubleshooting content, and video tutorials. I work closely with engineering, product, design, and support teams to ensure documentation is accurate, discoverable, and aligned with product strategy.
